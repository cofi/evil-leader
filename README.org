* What's Evil Leader?
  Evil Leader provides the =<leader>= feature from Vim that provides an easy way
  to bind keys under a variable prefix key. For an experienced Emacs User it is
  nothing more than a convoluted key map, but for a Evil user coming from Vim it
  means an easier start.

** Installation
   Put =evil-leader.el= into =load-path= and =(require 'evil-leader)=.

** Usage
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-evil-leader-mode)
   #+END_SRC
   to enable =evil-leader= in every buffer where =evil= is enabled.

   Note: You should enable =global-evil-leader-mode= before you enable =evil-mode=,
   otherwise =evil-leader= won't be enabled in initial buffers (=*scratch*=,
   =*Messages*=, ...).

   Use =evil-leader/set-key= to bind keys in the leader map.
   For example:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-leader/set-key "e" 'find-file)
   #+END_SRC
   You can also bind several keys at once:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-leader/set-key
  "e" 'find-file
  "b" 'switch-to-buffer
  "k" 'kill-buffer)
   #+END_SRC
   The key map can of course be filled in several places.

   After you set up the key map you can access the bindings by pressing =<leader>=
   (default: =\=) and the key(s). E.g. =\ e= would call =find-file= to open a file.

   If you wish to change so you can customize =evil-leader/leader= or call
   =evil-leader/set-leader=, e.g. =(evil-leader/set-leader ",")= to change it to
   ",".
   The leader has to be readable by =read-kbd-macro=, so using Space as a
   prefix key would be =(evil-leader/set-leader "<Space>")=.

   Beginning with version 0.3 evil-leader has support for mode-local bindings:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-leader/set-key-for-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode "b" 'byte-compile-file)
   #+END_SRC

   Again, you can bind several keys at once.

   A mode-local binding shadows a normal mode-independent binding.


** FAQ
*** <leader> is not working in certain buffers! Why?
    This can have two reasons. First, the buffer is not in normal state (like
    insert or emacs state). If you set =evil-leader/in-all-states= to non-nil
    (before loading evil-leader or via customize) you can access the leader
    keymap still with the non-normal-prefix + leader (default: =C-\=).

    Second, =<leader>= can be overshadowed by the current major-mode because
    evil-leader uses the global keymap which has a lower priority than the local
    keymap. To still use =<leader>= you have to either use another key or 

  Have a
    look at =C-h k <leader>=, if it is bound then it overshadows the evil-leader
    keymap.
