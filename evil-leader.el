;; Install:
;; (require 'evil-leader)

;; Usage:
;;
;; (global-evil-leader-mode)
;;
;;    to enable `evil-leader' in every buffer where `evil' is enabled.
;;
;;    Use `evil-leader/set-key' to bind keys in the leader map.
;;    For example:
;;
;; (evil-leader/set-key "e" 'find-file)
;;
;;    You can also bind several keys at once:
;;
;; (evil-leader/set-key
;;   "e" 'find-file
;;   "b" 'switch-to-buffer
;;   "k" 'kill-buffer)
;;
;;    The key map can of course be filled in several places.
;;
;;    After you set up the key map you can access the bindings by pressing =<leader>=
;;    (default: \) and the key(s). E.g. \ e would call `find-file' to open a file.
;;
;;    If you wish to change so you can customize =evil-leader/leader= or call
;;    `evil-leader/set-leader', e.g. (evil-leader/set-leader ",") to change it to
;;    ",".
;;    The leader has to be readable by `read-kbd-macro', so using Space as a
;;    prefix key would be (evil-leader/set-leader "<Space>").
;;
;;    Beginning with version 0.3 evil-leader has support for mode-local bindings:
;;
;; (evil-leader/set-key-for-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode "b" 'byte-compile-file)
;;
;;    Again, you can bind several keys at once.
;;
;;    A mode-local binding shadows a normal mode-independent binding.

;;; Code:

(require 'evil)

(defvar evil-leader--default-map (make-sparse-keymap)
